# marea's neovim config

After dealing with NvChad for a few months I've decided to switch over to a
simple(r) custom config.

Heavily modified from [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim).

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/marea/neovim-config.git "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/nvim
```
